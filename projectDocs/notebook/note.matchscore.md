## Score
---
For now the Team score array must be less than length 2, 
because all matches have maximum only 2 innings ?
test match have only 2 innings so far by looking Score API response
the super overs also treated as innings by the score API
is it possible score array more than length 2, if happens it will break UI and logic sure
